Welcome to the website for Year 9 Game Design. This website includes links to the exercises we cover in class as well as giving you access to other handy resources.

## PyGame Zero

The main development environment for Game Design is through the `Python` programming language using a library called `PyGame Zero`. PyGame Zero is a wrapper around the PyGame library that makes it easier to create games.

## Learning PyGame Zero

The following activities are designed to help you learn how to use PyGame Zero to create games. Each activity will introduce you to a new concept or feature of PyGame Zero and will provide you with an opportunity to practice using it.

Before beginning these activities, make sure you have accesed the [setup instructions](setup.md) to ensure you have the necessary software installed on your laptop.

Each lesson gives you:

- A brief introduction to the concept or feature being covered
- Sample code to demonstrate how to use the feature
- Opportunities for you to update the sample code
- A challenge to test your understanding of the feature
